(** **** Exercise: 4 stars (factorial)  *)
(** Recall that [n!] denotes the factorial of [n] (i.e. [n! =
    1*2*...*n]).  Here is an Imp program that calculates the factorial
    of the number initially stored in the variable [X] and puts it in
    the variable [Y]:
    {{ X = m }} 
  Y ::= 1 ;;
  WHILE X <> 0
  DO
     Y ::= Y * X ;;
     X ::= X - 1
  END
    {{ Y = m! }}

    Fill in the blanks in following decorated program:
    {{ X = m }} ->>
    {{                                      }}
  Y ::= 1;;
    {{                                      }}
  WHILE X <> 0
  DO   {{                                      }} ->>
       {{                                      }}
     Y ::= Y * X;;
       {{                                      }}
     X ::= X - 1
       {{                                      }}
  END
    {{                                      }} ->>
    {{ Y = m! }}
*)

Print fact.

Theorem factorial_correct: forall m,
  {{ fun st => st X = m }} 
  Y ::= ANum 1 ;;
  WHILE BNot (BEq (AId X) (ANum 0))
  DO
     Y ::= AMult (AId Y) (AId X) ;;
     X ::= AMinus (AId X) (ANum 1)
  END
  {{ fun st => st Y = fact m }}.
