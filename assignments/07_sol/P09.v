(** **** Exercise: 3 stars, optional (fold_bexp_Eq_informal)  *)
(** Here is an informal proof of the [BEq] case of the soundness
    argument for boolean expression constant folding.  Read it
    carefully and compare it to the formal proof that follows.  Then
    fill in the [BLe] case of the formal proof (without looking at the
    [BEq] case, if possible).

   _Theorem_: The constant folding function for booleans,
   [fold_constants_bexp], is sound.

   _Proof_: We must show that [b] is equivalent to [fold_constants_bexp],
   for all boolean expressions [b].  Proceed by induction on [b].  We
   show just the case where [b] has the form [BEq a1 a2].

   In this case, we must show

       beval st (BEq a1 a2)
     = beval st (fold_constants_bexp (BEq a1 a2)).

   There are two cases to consider:

     - First, suppose [fold_constants_aexp a1 = ANum n1] and
       [fold_constants_aexp a2 = ANum n2] for some [n1] and [n2].

       In this case, we have

           fold_constants_bexp (BEq a1 a2)
         = if beq_nat n1 n2 then BTrue else BFalse

       and

           beval st (BEq a1 a2)
         = beq_nat (aeval st a1) (aeval st a2).

       By the soundness of constant folding for arithmetic
       expressions (Lemma [fold_constants_aexp_sound]), we know

           aeval st a1
         = aeval st (fold_constants_aexp a1)
         = aeval st (ANum n1)
         = n1

       and

           aeval st a2
         = aeval st (fold_constants_aexp a2)
         = aeval st (ANum n2)
         = n2,

       so

           beval st (BEq a1 a2)
         = beq_nat (aeval a1) (aeval a2)
         = beq_nat n1 n2.

       Also, it is easy to see (by considering the cases [n1 = n2] and
       [n1 <> n2] separately) that

           beval st (if beq_nat n1 n2 then BTrue else BFalse)
         = if beq_nat n1 n2 then beval st BTrue else beval st BFalse
         = if beq_nat n1 n2 then true else false
         = beq_nat n1 n2.

       So

           beval st (BEq a1 a2)
         = beq_nat n1 n2.
         = beval st (if beq_nat n1 n2 then BTrue else BFalse),

       as required.

     - Otherwise, one of [fold_constants_aexp a1] and
       [fold_constants_aexp a2] is not a constant.  In this case, we
       must show

           beval st (BEq a1 a2)
         = beval st (BEq (fold_constants_aexp a1)
                         (fold_constants_aexp a2)),

       which, by the definition of [beval], is the same as showing

           beq_nat (aeval st a1) (aeval st a2)
         = beq_nat (aeval st (fold_constants_aexp a1))
                   (aeval st (fold_constants_aexp a2)).

       But the soundness of constant folding for arithmetic
       expressions ([fold_constants_aexp_sound]) gives us

         aeval st a1 = aeval st (fold_constants_aexp a1)
         aeval st a2 = aeval st (fold_constants_aexp a2),

       completing the case.  []

        specifying variable names a chore, but Coq doesn't always
        choose nice variable names.  We can rename entries in the
        context with the [rename] tactic: [rename a into a1] will
        change [a] to [a1] in the current goal and context.) *)
