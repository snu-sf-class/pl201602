Theorem loop_never_stops : forall st st',
  ~(loop / st \\ st').
Proof.
  intros st st' contra. unfold loop in contra.
  remember (WHILE BTrue DO SKIP END) as loopdef
           eqn:Heqloopdef.

  (** Proceed by induction on the assumed derivation showing that
      [loopdef] terminates.  Most of the cases are immediately
      contradictory (and so can be solved in one step with
      [inversion]). *)
