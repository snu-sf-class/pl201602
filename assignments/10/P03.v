(** The fact that small-step reduction implies big-step is now
    straightforward to prove, once it is stated correctly. 

    The proof proceeds by induction on the multi-step reduction
    sequence that is buried in the hypothesis [normal_form_of t t']. *)
(** Make sure you understand the statement before you start to
    work on the proof.  *)

(** **** Exercise: 3 stars (multistep__eval)  *)
